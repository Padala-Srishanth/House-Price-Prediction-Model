# House-Price-Prediction-Model 
This project is a House Price Prediction Model built using Streamlit, Scikit-learn, and Python. The model takes various input features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and more to predict the estimated price of a house. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a seamless experience for predicting house prices based on historical data.

The project is designed with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, and the machine learning model is trained using Scikit-learn. Additionally, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques were applied to ensure maximum prediction accuracy.

# Features of the Project
The House Price Prediction Model comes with the following features:
User-friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, allowing easy interaction with the model.
Real-time Predictions: Provides instant house price predictions based on user input.
Machine Learning Model: Uses Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms to train and test the model.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, outliers, and categorical features to ensure accurate predictions.
Model Deployment: Can be easily deployed on Streamlit Cloud or any web server.

# Technologies Used
The following technologies and tools were used to build the House Price Prediction Model:

Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Library: Scikit-learn
Web Framework: Streamlit
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model Saving: Pickle (model.pkl)

# Machine Learning Model Used
The model is trained using three different algorithms:

Linear Regression: Provides a linear relationship between input features and house prices.
Decision Tree Regressor: Handles complex non-linear relationships in the data.
Random Forest Regressor: Combines multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy.
The model with the highest accuracy was saved as a pickle file (model.pkl) and is used for real-time predictions.

# Future Enhancements
The project can be further improved by:
Integrating Google Maps API for location-based predictions.
Adding authentication using OAuth.
Deploying the model using Docker containers for scalability.
Using advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks for higher accuracy.
