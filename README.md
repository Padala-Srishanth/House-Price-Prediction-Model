Machine Learning Model
Algorithms Implemented
The model is trained and evaluated using multiple regression algorithms:

Linear Regression:

Provides baseline linear relationships between features and prices
Fast prediction and easy interpretability
Best for linearly separable data


Decision Tree Regressor:

Handles complex non-linear relationships
Captures feature interactions naturally
No assumption about data distribution


Random Forest Regressor:

Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees
Reduces overfitting through bagging
Higher accuracy through variance reduction
Selected as final model due to superior performance



Model Features

Input Features:

area (square feet)
bedrooms (number)
stories (number)
Additional categorical features: city, furnishing, amenities


Target Variable: price (USD)
Preprocessing:

StandardScaler normalization for numerical features
Missing value handling
Duplicate removal
Outlier detection and treatment


Model Persistence:

Trained model saved as model.pkl
Feature scaler saved as scaler.pkl
Easy loading for real-time predictions



Model Evaluation

Cross-validation techniques applied
Performance metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² score
Feature importance analysis
Prediction vs actual price visualization
